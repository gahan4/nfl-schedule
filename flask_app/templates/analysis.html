        Deep dive into the methodology, data sources, and technical decisions behind the NFL schedule optimization.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- Introduction Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The goal of the NFL schedule optimization model is to maximize viewership for primetime games while respecting certain constraints
        prescribed by the league. This page reviews more specifics of the process used to create the schedule.
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        At a high level, the schedule was created by creating a model to predict
        the likely number of viewers for any game in any slot and then optimizing
        to create a schedule that maximized the projected number of primetime viewers while adhering
        to various league constraints. The modeling step was divided into two parts,
        with a first-level model predicting the "intrigue" of each individual team as compared
        to the other teams in the league, and the second-level model predicting the number
        of viewers for a particular game given the intrigue of the teams involved.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Data Sources Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        In order to create the viewership models, we needed training data.
        The following data sources were used to collect information that was tested in the viewership model. 
        This information was collected for each team and season. Ideally, information
        tested in the model was required to have been known at the time of schedule creation, around 6 months prior to the first game of the season. 
        However, some information, such as market size and number of twitter followers, was taken 
        from the present day (Feb 2025).
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Viewership Data:</strong> Manually taken from SportsMediaWatch. An example link is <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nfl-tv-ratings-viewership-2023/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">here</a>. Data was uploaded to this website
        in the form of a picture, presenting the number of viewers in every game slot. Data was only acquired for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Note that data was not available for each game that was
        not independently rated - most relevant, there was no viewership figure for each specific Sunday afternoon game.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>General Team Information:</strong> Acquired via the nfl_data_py package. This included their name, division, city, etc.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Market Population:</strong> Scraped from a SportsMediaWatch article (<a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nba-market-size-nfl-mlb-nhl-nielsen-ratings/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Link</a>) using the pandas package.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Twitter Followers:</strong> Scraped from an article on <a href="https://www.sportsmillions.com/picks/nfl/which-nfl-team-has-the-most-x-twitter-followers" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">SportsMillions</a> using the BeautifulSoup package.
        Data is current as of Nov 2024.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Jersey Sales Rankings:</strong> Scraped from the NFLPA website using BeautifulSoup. An example of such a website is <a href="https://nflpa.com/partners/posts/top-50-nfl-player-sales-list-march-1-2021-february-28-2022" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">here</a>. The NFLPA publishes 
        a list of the top 50 players in apparel rankings over each league-season. For purposes here, all players were assigned to a specific team (the team they would be on the upcoming season), assigned a value using a decay
        function that assigned weight of 1 to the top-selling player and decayed by e^{-.05 * (Rank - 1)} for each subsequent player (so the 2nd highest seller would get weight ~.95, the 50th highest around ~.09), and then 
        the total score for each team was calculated.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Draft Intrigue Metric:</strong> Created to attempt to understand the impact of a team having high draft picks on viewership. Draft slot information was scraped from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup. The idea was to
        assign a value to each draft slot in a highly decayed manner, overwhelmingly upweighting top picks. However, this variable did not prove predictive in the Team Intrigue model, potentially because
        not all top picks were used on offensive players (especially QB's) who may have moved viewership.

<!-- Model Explanation Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Projecting Viewership</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        We used two primary models in the scheduling process: the <strong>Team Intrigue Model</strong> and the <strong>Game Viewership Model</strong>.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Team Intrigue Model</h3>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The <strong>Team Intrigue Model</strong> was built to predict the intrigue score of a team based on multiple features, including:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>Team performance (Win Percentage from previous season)</li>
        <li>Number of twitter followers</li>
        <li>Population of home market</li>
        <li>Popularity of individual players on team (measured using jersey sales)</li>
        <li>Key team changes such as the introduction of a new quarterback or the draft position (e.g., the team with the 1st overall pick could have more intrigue)</li>
        <li>Nuisance variables were added to account for game slot (i.e. SNF gets more viewership than TNF, games played as part of an MNF doubleheader get fewer viewers than standalone games)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        A Lasso regression model was selected for feature selection because it helps in determining the most influential variables while avoiding overfitting by applying L1 regularization.
        The bar plot below shows the coefficients that the model chose - note that
        all variables were normally scaled, and the response variable is "number of viewers". Aside from the nuisance variables,
        we see that the most important features are the previous season's win percentage, twitter followers, and weighted jersey sales,
        with market population and the presence of a new high-value QB providing some value. However, note that when creating
        the schedule in April, we don't know for sure which high-value QBs might change teams.
    </div>
    
    <div class="coefficient-plot">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Intrigue Model Feature Coefficients</h4>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/intrigue_model_coefficients.png') }}" alt="Intrigue Model Coefficients" class="analysis-image">
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        To go from the results of the model to a more understandable Intrigue Score,
        we simply scaled the results so that the mean intrigue score would be 100 and the standard deviation would be 20.
        To do this, we found the mean and standard deviation of projected SNF Viewers for 2022-23 teams (using the model above),
        then applying that same mean and standard deviation to 2025 teams.
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The table below shows all of the factors that contributed to the creation of team's
        intrigue scores for the 2025 season, as well as the scores from each team. The table
        is sortable by each column.
    </div>

                {% endfor %}
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Viewership Model</h3>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The <strong>Viewership Model</strong> predicts the viewership of a game based on the intrigue scores of the two teams involved. Factors included in this model:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Intrigue Scores of Both Teams:</strong> Based on the <strong>Team Intrigue Model</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Additional Factors:</strong> Whether the game is a divisional matchup, which could increase interest</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> A major challenge in building this model was the relatively small number of games with low-ranked teams, leading to a risk of overfitting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        A Lasso model was also chosen here. In our particular case, we are particularly worried about overfitting because of limitations
        in the data sample. Notably, we only had 2 seasons worth of data, and only had data available for
        primetime games. As a result, model structures that featured more complex interactions between the two teams caused non-intuitive
        behavior. As an example, there have not been many games where two "non-intriguing" teams have played in primetime. As
        a result, these sorts of games were not in the training data, though there are certainly many games on the schedule
        between two non-intriguing teams. But, many complex model structures were unable to learn that these games are likely
        to be very unpopular, so overweighted on the few such primetime games (which were probably put in primetime because
        of a factor not considered in the intrigue model), causing non-desired behavior.
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        As an example, the plot below shows the number of "viewers over expected" based on the intrigue score of the two
        teams. Here, expectation is determined simply by meta-factors such as the game's slot.
    </div>
    
    <div class="coefficient-plot">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Viewership Over Expected</h4>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/viewership_over_expected.png') }}" alt="Viewership Over Expected" class="analysis-image">
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        So, one of the main questions of this particular modeling question is how to derive a reasonable
        model given limitations of the viewership dataset. We know certain behavior that we expect to see,
        but not exactly how to relate the intrigue score of the two teams together. In the end,
        the model that was chosen was again a Lasso regression model, with the features and their 
        coefficient values shown in the plot below. The key question here was to find some 
        selection of variables related to the intrigue score of the two teams that led to increased
        viewership projections as both teams got better. Many options were tried, and in the end,
        the two most impactful such variables were "Max Intrigue Over Average", defined as the maximum
        intrigue of the two teams minus 100 if the maximum intrigue was over 100 and 0 otherwise,
        and "Product Of Intrigue Over Average", defined as the product of the intrigue-over-100 score
        for both teams (Intrigue - 100 if Intrigue > 100, 0 otherwise).
    </div>
