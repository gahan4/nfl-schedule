        On this page, we dive deep into methodology, data sources, and technical decisions that led to this prototype NFL schedule.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- Introduction Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The NFL faces the complex challenge of scheduling a prescribed set of 272 games over an 18-week regular season. Each week, games are played across a set of different television slots, including three slots of high-profile primetime windows (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday nights). In this prototype schedule, we aim to maximize the projected number of viewers for these primetime games, while also adhering to a wide range of constraints related to travel, competitive balance, stadium logistics, broadcast requirements, etc. This project explores how data-driven modeling and optimization can be used to generate a schedule that balances these goals and constraints.
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The core steps of the project were:
    </div>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathered historical viewership data, team statistics, market sizes, and other relevant features from web sources and league reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Projecting Viewership for Each Game:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                <li>Created an <strong>intrigue score</strong> for each team based on factors like win percentage, social media following, market size, and jersey sales.</li>
                <li>Used these intrigue scores as key features in a model to predict the number of viewers for each game.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Schedule Optimization:</strong> Formulated the problem as a mathematical optimization problem, incorporating league constraints and maximizing projected viewership.</li>
        <li><strong>App Creation:</strong> Built this interactive web application to visualize, explore, and explain the results.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<!-- Data Sources Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        In order to create the viewership models, we needed training data.
        The following data sources were used to collect information that was tested in the viewership model. 
        This information was collected for each team and season. Ideally, information
        tested in the model was required to have been known at the time of schedule creation, around 6 months prior to the first game of the season. 
        However, some information, such as market size and number of twitter followers, was taken 
        from the present day (Feb 2025).
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Viewership Data:</strong> Manually taken from SportsMediaWatch. An example link is <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nfl-tv-ratings-viewership-2023/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">here</a>. Data was uploaded to SportsMediaWatch
        in the form of a picture, presenting the number of viewers in every game slot. Data was only acquired for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Data was only available for each game that was
        independently rated - most importantly, there were no viewership figures for each Sunday afternoon game.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>General Team Information:</strong> Acquired via the nfl_data_py package. This included each team's name, division, city, etc.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Market Population:</strong> The number of residents in the home television market of each team was taken from a SportsMediaWatch article (<a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nba-market-size-nfl-mlb-nhl-nielsen-ratings/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Link</a>).
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Twitter Followers:</strong> Scraped from an article on <a href="https://www.sportsmillions.com/picks/nfl/which-nfl-team-has-the-most-x-twitter-followers" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">SportsMillions</a> using the BeautifulSoup package.
        Data is current as of Nov 2024.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Jersey Sales Rankings:</strong> Scraped from the NFLPA website using BeautifulSoup. An example of such a website is <a href="https://nflpa.com/partners/posts/top-50-nfl-player-sales-list-march-1-2021-february-28-2022" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">here</a>. The NFLPA publishes 
        a list of the top 50 players in apparel rankings over each league-season. For purposes here, all players were assigned to a specific team (the team they would be on the upcoming season), assigned a value using a decay
        function that assigned weight of 1 to the top-selling player and decayed by e^{-.05 * (Rank - 1)} for each subsequent player (so the 2nd highest seller would get weight ~.95, the 50th highest around ~.09), and then 
        the total score for each team was calculated.
    </div>
    
    <div class="data-source-item">
        <strong>Draft Intrigue Metric:</strong> Created to attempt to understand the impact of a team having high draft picks on viewership. Draft slot information was scraped from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup. The idea was to
        assign a value to each draft slot in a highly decayed manner, overwhelmingly upweighting top picks. However, this variable did not prove predictive in the Team Intrigue model, potentially because
        not all top picks were used on offensive players (especially QB's) who may have moved viewership.

<!-- Model Explanation Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Projecting Viewership</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        We used two primary models in the scheduling process: the <strong>Team Intrigue Model</strong> and the <strong>Game Viewership Model</strong>.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Team Intrigue Model</h3>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The Team Intrigue Model was built to determine the factors that lead each individual team to drive television viewership. The model was trained to predict, for each team, the number of viewers in a primetime game in which that team participated (i.e., the response variable was the number of viewers for a game, with each game appearing twice in the training data—once for each team involved). Each row in the training data corresponded to a team-game pair for a primetime matchup. Non-primetime games were not included in this process, as the freely available data did not report the number of viewers for each individual Sunday afternoon game; instead, only the total number of viewers for the window was reported, and since multiple games are played in parallel in different parts of the country, it was challenging to attribute viewership to specific games.
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The following metrics were tested as features in the model:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>Team performance (Win Percentage from previous season)</li>
        <li>Number of twitter followers</li>
        <li>Population of home market</li>
        <li>Popularity of individual players on team (measured using jersey sales)</li>
        <li>Key team changes such as the introduction of a new quarterback or the draft position (e.g., the team with the 1st overall pick could have more intrigue)</li>
        <li>Nuisance variables were added to account for game slot (i.e. SNF gets more viewership than TNF, games played as part of an MNF doubleheader get fewer viewers than standalone games)</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        A Lasso regression model was selected for feature selection because it helped in determining the most influential variables while avoiding overfitting by applying L1 regularization. The bar plot below shows the coefficients that the model chose. All variables were normally scaled, and the response variable was the number of viewers for a team in a primetime game. Aside from the nuisance variables, the most important features were the previous season's win percentage, twitter followers, and weighted jersey sales, with market population and the presence of a new high-value QB providing some value. However, when creating the schedule in April, it was not always possible to know for sure which high-value QBs might change teams.
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        To help better contextualize how much viewership each team would drive, we created an <strong>Intrigue Score</strong>. To translate from the results of the team viewership model to the Intrigue Score, we projected the number of viewers that would watch a Sunday Night game involving each team in the training set, and scaled that projection onto a scale with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 20. That is, a team that would be projected for an average number of viewers (as compared to all team-seasons in the training set) would have an Intrigue Score of 100, while teams projected for one standard deviation more viewers would have an Intrigue Score of 120.
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The table below shows the projected Intrigue Score for each team in the 2025 NFL season, as well as the relevant metrics that helped to create the score. The table is sortable by each column.

            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Viewership Model</h3>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The <strong>Viewership Model</strong> predicts the viewership of a game based on the intrigue scores of the two teams involved. Factors included in this model:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Intrigue Scores of Both Teams:</strong> Based on the <strong>Team Intrigue Model</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Additional Factors:</strong> Whether the game is a divisional matchup, which could increase interest</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> A major challenge in building this model was the relatively small number of games with low-ranked teams, leading to a risk of overfitting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        A Lasso model was also chosen here. In our particular case, we are particularly worried about overfitting because of limitations
        in the data sample. Notably, we only had 2 seasons worth of data, and only had data available for
        primetime games. As a result, model structures that featured more complex interactions between the two teams caused non-intuitive
        behavior. As an example, there have not been many games where two "non-intriguing" teams have played in primetime. As
        a result, these sorts of games were not in the training data, though there are certainly many games on the schedule
        between two non-intriguing teams. But, many complex model structures were unable to learn that these games are likely
        to be very unpopular, so overweighted on the few such primetime games (which were probably put in primetime because
        of a factor not considered in the intrigue model), causing non-desired behavior.
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        As an example, the plot below shows the number of "viewers over expected" based on the intrigue score of the two
        teams. Here, expectation is determined simply by meta-factors such as the game's slot.
    </div>
    
    <div class="coefficient-plot">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Viewership Over Expected</h4>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/viewership_over_expected.png') }}" alt="Viewership Over Expected" class="analysis-image">
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        So, one of the main questions of this particular modeling question is how to derive a reasonable
        model given limitations of the viewership dataset. We know certain behavior that we expect to see,
        but not exactly how to relate the intrigue score of the two teams together. In the end,
        the model that was chosen was again a Lasso regression model, with the features and their 
        coefficient values shown in the plot below. The key question here was to find some 
        selection of variables related to the intrigue score of the two teams that led to increased
        viewership projections as both teams got better. Many options were tried, and in the end,
        the two most impactful such variables were "Max Intrigue Over Average", defined as the maximum
        intrigue of the two teams minus 100 if the maximum intrigue was over 100 and 0 otherwise (see below),
        and "Product Of Intrigue Over Average", defined as the product of the intrigue-over-100 score
        for both teams (Intrigue - 100 if Intrigue > 100, 0 otherwise).
    </div>
    
    <div class="math-formula">
        \[
        \text{IntrigueOverAvg}(I) = \begin{cases}
            I - 100 & \text{if } I > 100 \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
        \]
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The plot below shows the coefficients that were learned by the model. The most impactful variables (outside of the nuisance variables) are those dealing with intrigue over average. In particular, adding other variables that dealt with possible relationships between the teams—such as whether or not they are in the same division—was not found to be impactful.

<!-- Schedule Formulation Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Schedule Formulation</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        Using the models above, we had a projection for how many viewers each of the 272 NFL games would be projected to garner in each slot. The next step was to set up an optimization formulation to maximize the number of primetime viewers, while respecting the various constraints that the league needs to adhere to. The scheduling problem was set up as a binary integer program. This involved
        creating an objective function and constraint matricies, and mathematically
        enumerating each of the rules that we want to see in our schedule.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Constraints</h3>

    <h3>Solver Setup and Problem Formulation</h3>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The scheduling problem was formulated as an <strong>integer programming</strong> problem.
    </div>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The problem is set up as follows:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Binary variable \(x_{ijk}\) was defined for each matchup \(i\), week \(j\), and slot \(k\). With 272 matchups, 18 weeks, and 4 slots per week, this created 19,584 binary variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong> Created by projecting the number of viewers for each matchup in each slot. Assume that all games not in a primetime slot would have 0 viewers.</li>
        <li><strong>Constraint Matrices:</strong> Matrices representing the various constraints, applied</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        In total, the final model had <strong>19,584 variables</strong>, <strong>588 equality constraints</strong>, and <strong>6,772 inequality constraints</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The mathematical formulation for the problem is:
    </div>
    <div class="math-formula">
        <div style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <strong>Maximize:</strong> \(f^T x\)
        </div>
        <div style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            <strong>Subject to:</strong><br>
            \(A_{\text{in}} x \leq b_{\text{in}}\)<br>
            \(A_{\text{eq}} x = b_{\text{eq}}\)<br>
            \(x \in \{0,1\}^n\)
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        Where:
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>\(f \in \mathbb{R}^n\): vector of objective coefficients</li>
        <li>\(x \in \{0,1\}^n\): binary decision variables</li>
        <li>\(A_{\text{in}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_1 \times n}\): matrix of inequality constraint coefficients</li>
        <li>\(b_{\text{in}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_1}\): right-hand side for inequality constraints</li>
        <li>\(A_{\text{eq}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_2 \times n}\): matrix of equality constraint coefficients</li>
        <li>\(b_{\text{eq}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_2}\): right-hand side for equality constraints</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        The problem was solved using a CBC solver through Google's OR-Tools, which efficiently handled large constraint sets.
        The solver ran for about 2 hours on a personal laptop.

<!-- Limitations Section -->
<div class="analysis-section">
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <div class="wrapped-text">
        This project was executed as a personal project, not as an attempt to build a commercially viable result. As such, it lacks access to resources that a company or organization would typically have, such as more powerful optimization solvers, larger datasets for model training, and more comprehensive data sources for viewership analysis.
    </div>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 ml-4 mb-4">
        <li>Viewership data was only available for the 2022 and 2023 seasons, and only for games that were independently rated. Most notably, there was no viewership figure for each specific Sunday afternoon game; only the total number of viewers for the window was reported, making it challenging to attribute viewership to individual games.</li>
        <li>Non-primetime games were not included in the training data for the viewership models, due to the lack of individual game viewership data for those windows.</li>
        <li>The viewership models were trained on a relatively small sample (two seasons), limiting the ability to learn more features or complex relationships that have tended to impact game viewership over a long time horizon.</li>
        <li>Some features, such as market size and Twitter followers, were taken from the present day (Feb/Nov2024) rather than what would have been known at the time of schedule creation.</li>
        <li>Some constraints and objectives were chosen based on public information and personal judgment, rather than through a formal requirements-gathering process.</li>
        <li>Limited computational power: the optimization problem was solved on a personal laptop using a free solver (CBC), which required reducing the complexity of the problem and the types of constraints that could be handled. For example, constraints regarding the number of games a team could play against opponents coming off a bye week were not included due to problem size limitations.</li>
        <li>Missing constraints that would be present in a real NFL schedule, such as international games, more detailed stadium conflicts, and additional bye week restrictions.</li>
