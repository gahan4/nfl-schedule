    Welcome to the **NFL Scheduling App**! This platform presents a prototype schedule for the 2025 NFL season. The schedule was created to maximize primetime television viewership across the season,
    while respecting leaguewide constraints related to competitive balance, travel, etc.

    Creating the schedule breaks down into 4 main phases: 
    - **Data Collection**: Find information from the web relevant to understanding the state of primetime television viewership and the parameters of the 2025 NFL schedule.
    - **Viewership Modeling**: Using historical data, determine the variables that lead to individual teams attracting more viewership, and then to games more broadly, to project the number of viewers for each game in each of the different primetime windows.
    - **Scheduling**: Applying the viewership model to all 272 matchups in the 2025 NFL season, and using mathematical optimization techniques
            to find the schedule that respects all mandated scheduling constraints (related to )
    - **App Creation**: Making the app that you are looking at right now!

    # Intrigue Score Explanation
    st.header("Methods Used")
    st.markdown("""
        All code for this project was written in Python.
        1. Data collection involved web scraping using BeautifulSoup, as well as some manual entry of data from trickier sources.
        2. The viewership model involved a two-step process. Firstly, a "team intrigue" model was fit to determine the 
           expected number of viewers who would watch a game given just one individual team. Secondly, a model was fit to predict
           the number of viewers given the intrigue scores of the teams (among other factors). These models
           were lasso models fit using 5-fold cross-validation in the scikit-learn package. A data pipeline was created
           to handle feature engineering and preprocessing. 
        3. Scheduling was done using integer linear optimization techniques (ILP), achieved with Google's OR-TOOLS package
            in Python. 
    """)

    st.header("Limitations")
    st.markdown("""
        This schedule probably isn't ready for the prime time. Here are some areas where it falls short, relative to what would be required for a real NFL schedule:
- Viewership data was collected from public sources from just 2 seasons of games (2022-23), and only for games in the traditional primetime windows. Real practitioners would hopefully have a much more robust viewership dataset. 
- Only a small number of variables were tested to create the viewership model, and just 2 were included in the final model. Real practitioners would probably spend more time collecting possible factors for their viewership model and testing different model architectures with their more robust dataset.
- To solve for the optimal schedule, a free solver (called CBC) was run on a personal laptop. Real practitioners would have access to better solvers and bigger machines.
- As a result of the limited computational power available, not every constraint that the league might consider was included. For example, this schedule does not account for international games or dates when a team's stadium might be used by other uses (e.g. concerts). Additionally, certain competition constraints, like restrictions on instances of playing a team coming off its bye, were not used in this process.

    # Intrigue Score Explanation
    st.header("What is the Intrigue Score?")
    st.markdown("""
    The **Intrigue Score** is a metric designed to quantify a team's appeal to viewers. It is the basis for the viewership model. It's calculated using several factors:
    - **Win Percentage**: Teams with higher recent success tend to attract more viewers.
    - **Twitter Followers**: A larger social media following indicates greater fan engagement.
    - **Jersey Sales Leaders**: Popular players often boost a team's attractiveness.
    - **Market Size**: Teams from larger markets typically draw more attention.

    # Game Viewership Model
    st.header("Game Viewership Model")
    st.markdown("""
    To project the number of viewers for each game, we've developed a model that considers:
    - **Team Intrigue Scores**: Both participating teams' scores influence expected viewership.
    - **Game Slot**: Prime-time slots like Thursday Night Football (TNF), Sunday Night Football (SNF), and Monday Night Football (MNF) generally attract more viewers.

        ### Key
        - **Win Pct** Team's win percentage during the 2024 regular season.
        - **Twitter Followers**: Team's number of twitter followers (in Nov 2024)
        - **Weighted Jersey Sales**: Each player who finished in Top 50 of NFL apparel sales (according to NFLPA) was
          given a score (1 for highest-seller, down to ~.1 for 50th highest seller), and Weighted Jersey Sales variable
          takes sum of scores for all players expected to be on team in 2025.
        - **Market Population**: Number of people who live in the team's home TV market.
        - **Intrigue Score**: Model's prediction of how "intriguing" the team will be to watch, with 100 being average,
             and higher values being better. As a frame of reference, an intrigue of 120 would indicate the team is
             one standard deviation more intriguing than league average, 80 is one standard deviation less intriguing
             than league average.
