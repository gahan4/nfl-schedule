    Creating the schedule breaks down into 4 main phases: 
    - **Data Collection**: Find information from the web relevant to understanding the state of primetime television viewership and the parameters of the 2025 NFL schedule.
    - **Viewership Modeling**: Using historical data, determine the variables that lead to individual teams attracting more viewership, and then to games more broadly, to project the number of viewers for each game in each of the different primetime windows.
    - **Scheduling**: Applying the viewership model to all 272 matchups in the 2025 NFL season, and using mathematical optimization techniques
            to find the schedule that respects all mandated scheduling constraints (related to )
    - **App Creation**: Making the app that you are looking at right now!

    # Intrigue Score Explanation
    st.header("Methods Used")
    st.markdown("""
        All code for this project was written in Python.
        1. Data collection involved web scraping using BeautifulSoup, as well as some manual entry of data from trickier sources.
        2. The viewership model involved a two-step process. Firstly, a "team intrigue" model was fit to determine the 
           expected number of viewers who would watch a game given just one individual team. Secondly, a model was fit to predict
           the number of viewers given the intrigue scores of the teams (among other factors). These models
           were lasso models fit using 5-fold cross-validation in the scikit-learn package. A data pipeline was created
           to handle feature engineering and preprocessing. 
        3. Scheduling was done using integer linear optimization techniques (ILP), achieved with Google's OR-TOOLS package
            in Python.

    st.header("Limitations")
    st.markdown("""
        This schedule probably isn't ready for the prime time. Here are some areas where it falls short, relative to what would be required for a real NFL schedule:
- Viewership data was collected from public sources for just 2 seasons of games (2022-23), and only for games in the traditional primetime windows. Real practitioners would hopefully have a much more robust viewership dataset. 
- Only a small number of variables were tested to create the viewership model, and just 2 were included in the final model. Real practitioners would probably spend more time collecting possible factors for their viewership model and testing different model architectures with their more robust dataset.
- To solve for the optimal schedule, a free solver (called CBC) was run on a personal laptop. Real practitioners would have access to better solvers and bigger machines.
- As a result of the limited computational power available, not every constraint that the league might consider was included. For example, this schedule does not account for international games or dates when a team's stadium might be used by other uses (e.g. concerts). Additionally, certain competition constraints, like restrictions on instances of playing a team coming off its bye, were not used in this process.

    # Intrigue Score Explanation
    st.header("Modeling Methodology")
    st.markdown("""
    The **Intrigue Score** is a metric designed to quantify a team's appeal to viewers. It is the basis for the viewership model. It's calculated using several factors:
    - **Win Percentage**: Teams with higher recent success tend to attract more viewers.
    - **Twitter Followers**: A larger social media following indicates greater fan engagement.
    - **Jersey Sales Leaders**: Popular players often boost a team's attractiveness.
    - **Market Size**: Teams from larger markets typically draw more attention.
    
    A second model predicts the number of viewers for each game, based off the following factors:
    - **Team Intrigue Scores**: Both participating teams' scores influence expected viewership.
    - **Game Slot**: Prime-time slots like Thursday Night Football (TNF), Sunday Night Football (SNF), and Monday Night Football (MNF) generally attract more viewers.

        In order to create the viewership models, we needed training data.
        The following data sources were used to collect information that was tested in the viewership model. 
        This information was collected for each team and season. Ideally, information
        tested in the model was required to have been known at the time of schedule creation, around 6 months prior to the first game of the season. 
        However, some information, such as market size and number of twitter followers, was taken 
        from the present day (Feb 2025).

              in the form of a picture, presenting the number of viewers in every game slot. Data was only acquired for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Note that data was not available for each game that was
              not independently rated - most relevant, there was no viewership figure for each specific Sunday afternoon game.
            - General information about teams was acquired via the nfl_data_py package. This included their name, division, city, etc.
            - The population of each team's home market was scraped from a SportsMediaWatch article ([Link](https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nba-market-size-nfl-mlb-nhl-nielsen-ratings/)) using the pandas package.
            - The number of twitter followers for each team was scraped from an article on [SportsMillions](https://www.sportsmillions.com/picks/nfl/which-nfl-team-has-the-most-x-twitter-followers) using the BeautifulSoup package.
              Data is current as of Nov 2024.
            - The jersey sales rankings were scraped from the NFLPA website using BeautifulSoup. An example of such a website is [here](https://nflpa.com/partners/posts/top-50-nfl-player-sales-list-march-1-2021-february-28-2022). The NFLPA publishes 
              a list of the top 50 players in apparel rankings over each league-season. For purposes here, all players were assigned to a specific team (the team they would be on the upcoming season), assigned a value using a decay
              function that assigned weight of 1 to the top-selling player and decayed by e^{-.05 * (Rank - 1)} for each subsequent player (so the 2nd highest seller would get weight ~.95, the 50th highest around ~.09), and then 
              the total score for each team was calculated.
            - A draft intrigue metric was created to attempt to understand the impact of a team having high draft picks on viewership. Draft slot information was scraped from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup. The idea was to
              assign a value to each draft slot in a highly decayed manner, overwhelmingly upweighting top picks. However, this variable did not prove predictive in the Team Intrigue model, potentially because
              not all top picks were used on offensive players (especially QB's) who may have moved viewership.
            - The required matchups for the 2025 season were scraped from a league press release ([link](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/2025-opponents-determined/)) using BeautifulSoup.

        - Team performance (Win Percentage from previous season)
        - Number of twitter followers

        - Popularity of individual players ont eam (measured using jersey sales)
        - Key team changes such as the introduction of a new quarterback or the draft position (e.g., the team with the 1st overall pick could have more intrigue).
        - Nuisance variables were added to account for game slot (i.e. SNF gets more viewership than TNF,

        The scheduling problem was formulated as an **integer programming** problem using Google's OR-Tools. A binary variable \(x_{ijk}\) was introduced to represent whether **matchup i** occurs in **week j** at **slot k**.
    
        The problem is set up as follows:
        - **Variables**: Binary variable $x_{ijk}$ was defined for each matchup i, week j, and slot k. With 272 matchups, 18 weeks,
            and 4 slots per week, this created 19,584 binary variables.
        - **Objective Function**: Created by projecting the number of viewers for each matchup in each slot. Assume
           that all games not in a primetime slot would have 0 viewers.
        
        In total, the final model had:
        - **588 equality constraints**
        - **5748 inequality constraints**
        
        The final problem was solved using a CBC solver through Google's OR-Tools, which efficiently handles large constraint sets.
        The solver was allowed to run for 2 hours on a personal laptop.
